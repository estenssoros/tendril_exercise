Artist Id|A unique idea associated with each artist.
Artist Name|This field is not unique as artist_id. E.g Juelz Santana, Juelz Santana / Bezel and Juelz Santana / Freekey Zeekey / Monique Garnett all have the artist_id ARZXTEY1187B9997A7.
Duration|How long a song is in seconds.
Artist Familiarity|That's a good question. From the documentation, this field is an "algorithmic estimation". My best assumption is that this is akin to how long an artist has managed to stay popular.
Artist Hotttnesss|Besides having too many t's and s's, this field is also algorithmically estimated and could possibly indicated how popular the artist was at the time of song release.
sha256|A one-way 256-bit hash of the artist name. E.g Taylor Swift's sha256 hash is c2ce09cb217d8d65cc7085546021ff3468401b68b634e963323f2bdfe030bc8e and Wildest Dreams is the greatest music video of all time.
